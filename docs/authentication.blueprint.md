# Strm_: Authentication Blueprint (2026)

This document provides a clear, non-technical overview of how user authentication is handled within the Strm_ application, incorporating a robust, administrator-controlled access model.

---

## 1. Authentication & Onboarding Flow

The application uses Google Sign-In as its sole method of authentication. Access is strictly controlled by administrators to ensure workspace security. A user can gain access in one of three ways:

* **Method A: First User Auto-Approval (Bootstrap Flow)**
* **Method B: Administrator Invitation (Recommended)**
* **Method C: User-Initiated Access Request**

---

### Method A: First User Auto-Approval (Bootstrap Flow)

This method ensures the very first person to sign into a new, empty Strm_ environment automatically becomes the system administrator.

**Step 1: New User Signs In to an Empty System**
A new user navigates to the application URL and is the first person ever to click "Sign in with Google."

**Step 2: System Detects No Existing Users**
Firebase authenticates the user. The application then checks the `/users` collection in Firestore and finds that it is empty for the current workspace.

**Step 3: Admin Profile Creation & Full Access Granted**
Because this is the first user, the system creates their profile with two special properties:
* `isAdmin` is set to `true`.
* `accountType` is set to `'Full'`.
The user is immediately granted full administrative access to the entire application.

### Method B: Administrator Invitation (Recommended Flow)

This is the most secure and user-friendly method for adding new team members once an administrator exists.

**Step 1: Admin Sends an Invitation**
An existing administrator uses a dedicated "Pre-approve User" form within the application to enter the email address of the new user. This action securely adds the email to a `pre-approved-emails` collection in the database.

**Step 2: User Receives an Email**
A Cloud Function is automatically triggered by the new entry in the `pre-approved-emails` collection. This function sends a welcome email to the new user with a link to the Strm_ login page.

**Step 3: User Clicks "Sign in with Google"**
The new user clicks the link and uses the "Sign in with Google" button. Google will prompt them to grant the application permission to view their calendar information if they have not done so before.

**Step 4: System Verifies Invitation & Creates Profile**
Firebase Authentication confirms the user's identity. The application checks the `pre-approved-emails` list and finds a match. It then creates a new user profile in the Firestore `/users` collection, populating it with their Google account details (Name, Email, Profile Picture), setting their `accountType` to 'Full', and granting them full access immediately. The `googleCalendarLinked` flag is set to `true` after they approve the permissions via the separate redirect flow.

### Method C: User-Initiated Access Request (Reactive Flow)

This flow handles "walk-up" attempts, where a user who has not been invited tries to access the application.

**Step 1: New User Signs In**
A new, uninvited user navigates to the application URL and clicks "Sign in with Google."

**Step 2: System Creates a "Pending" Profile**
Firebase authenticates the user. The application checks Firestore, finds no existing user and that the user is not pre-approved, and creates a new user document. **Crucially, it sets the `accountType` to `'Viewer'`, which restricts all access.** The `googleCalendarLinked` flag will initially be `false`.

**Step 3: Administrator Notification**
* **In-App:** A notification appears in the administrator's notification list, stating that a new user has requested access.
* **Via Email (Recommended Backend):** A **Cloud Function** is automatically triggered. This function sends an email to all system administrators, alerting them of the new request and providing a direct link to the approval page.

**Step 4: Administrator Action**
The administrator reviews the request in the in-app notification list. They have two options:
* **Approve:** The administrator clicks "Approve." The system updates the user's `accountType` in Firestore from `'Viewer'` to `'Full'`.
* **Reject:** The administrator clicks "Reject." The system deletes the user's document from Firestore and revokes their authentication token.

**Step 5: Access Granted or Denied**
The user will be granted full access the next time they refresh the application (if approved) or will be unable to log in (if rejected). They may then be prompted to link their Google Calendar separately if they haven't already.

## 2. Data Storage: The User Profile

All information related to a user's application experience is stored in a dedicated `/users` collection within the Firestore database. Each user has a single document, identified by their unique Firebase ID.

| Data Point | Purpose in the Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| `userId` | The unique, non-changing ID that links the user's login identity to their profile. |
| `displayName` | The user's full name, displayed throughout the application (e.g., in team lists, event assignments). |
| `email` | The user's email address, used for identification and notifications. |
| `avatarUrl` | A direct link to the user's profile picture, shown in the sidebar, team lists, and user menus. |
| `isAdmin` | A simple `true` or `false` flag that determines if the user has access to administrative pages and features. |
| `accountType` | Defines the user's access level. `Viewer` is a pending state. `Full` has access. |
| `googleCalendarLinked` | A `true` or `false` flag indicating if the user has successfully linked their Google Calendar. |
| `title` | The user's professional title (e.g., "Video Editor"), displayed under their name. |
| `roles` | A list of Badge IDs assigned to the user, defining their skills or responsibilities. |
| `memberOfTeamIds` | A list of Team IDs the user belongs to. This is crucial for controlling access to team-specific pages. |
| `theme` | A UI preference for the app's color scheme (`light` or `dark`). |
| `primaryColor` | A user-selected color that overrides the theme's default accent color. |
| `defaultCalendarView`| The user's preferred view (Month, Week, Day, etc.) that the calendar will load by default. |
| `easyBooking` | A `true` or `false` flag for enabling the "click-to-create-event" feature on the calendar. |
| `timeFormat` | A UI preference for displaying time in 12-hour or 24-hour format. |
| `linked...Ids` | Lists of IDs for shared Teams, Badge Collections, or Calendars that the user has chosen to link to their personal management boards. |
| `modifierKey`| The keyboard key (`Shift`, `Alt`, etc.) the user must hold down to perform secondary actions like resetting preferences. |
| `createdAt` | The timestamp of when the user's account was first created in the system. |
| `approvedBy` | The `userId` of the administrator who approved the user's account request, or 'system' for the first user. |

---

## 3. Data Origin: Google vs. Application Defaults

When a new user signs in for the first time, their profile is created from a mix of data from Google and default values set by the application.

| Data Point | Origin |
| :--- | :--- |
| `userId` | **Google:** The unique ID from Firebase Authentication. |
| `displayName` | **Google:** The user's full name from their Google profile. |
| `email` | **Google:** The user's primary email address from their Google profile. |
| `avatarUrl` | **Google:** The URL of their Google profile picture. |
| `googleCalendarLinked`| **Application:** Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` by the application only after the user successfully completes the separate OAuth consent flow for calendar access. |
| --- | --- |
| `isAdmin` | **Application:** Defaults to `true` if the user is the first one in the database, otherwise `false`. |
| `accountType` | **Application:** Defaults to `Viewer` for user-initiated requests, `Full` for invited users, or `Full` for the first user. |
| `title` | **Application:** This is empty by default and must be set by an admin or the user. |
| `roles` | **Application:** This is empty by default. Roles are assigned within the app. |
| `memberOfTeamIds` | **Application:** This is empty by default. Users are added to teams within the app. |
| `theme` | **Application:** Defaults to `light`. |
| `primaryColor` | **Application:** Is not set by default. |
| `defaultCalendarView`| **Application:** Defaults to `day`. |
| `easyBooking` | **Application:** Is not set by default. |
| `timeFormat` | **Application:** Is not set by default. |
| `linked...Ids` | **Application:** All are empty by default. |
| `modifierKey`| **Application:** Defaults to `shift`. |
| `createdAt` | **Application:** Set to the current timestamp on creation. |
| `approvedBy` | **Application:** Set to 'system' for the first user, or the admin's `userId` upon approval. |

## 4. Security and Best Practices

This authentication system is significantly more secure and robust than the previous mock-data system for several key reasons:

* **No Password Handling:** The most critical improvement is that our application **never handles or stores user passwords**. The entire sign-in process is delegated to Google and Firebase, which are built to handle this securely.
* **Trusted Identity Provider:** By using Google Sign-In, we are leveraging a globally trusted identity provider. Users can sign in with an account they already know and trust.
* **Centralized, Controlled Access**: The approval workflow ensures that only authorized individuals can access the Strm_ environment, preventing unauthorized sign-ups.
* **Secure Session Management:** Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener securely manages the user's session. It uses industry-standard tokens, which are automatically refreshed and secured, protecting against unauthorized access.
* **Centralized Authentication Logic:** All authentication logic is now centralized within the `user-context.tsx` file and uses the official Firebase SDK. This reduces complexity and eliminates the risk of inconsistent or insecure implementations elsewhere in the app.
* **Single Source of Truth:** Using Firebase Auth as the single source of truth for a user's identity prevents the creation of duplicate accounts, which was a key issue with the previous system.
