# Strm_: Standardized Card Component Pattern (2026)

This document outlines the definitive, standardized UI pattern for all "management cards" within the Strm_ environment. These cards are used for displaying and interacting with primary entities like Pages, Teams, Calendars, and Badge Collections. Adhering to this pattern ensures a consistent, predictable, and visually harmonious user experience.

## 1. Core Structure & Layout

All management cards must be built using the `<Card>` component from `shadcn/ui`.

-   **Component**: `src/components/ui/card.tsx`
-   **Anatomy**:
   -   `<Card>`: The root container. Must have a `bg-transparent` class to rely on its border for definition.
   -   `<CardHeader className="p-2">`: The header area. **Must** use `p-2` for compact padding.
   -   `<CardContent className="p-2 pt-0">`: The main content area. **Must** use `p-2 pt-0` for tight vertical spacing.
   -   `<CardTitle>`: The primary name of the entity. **Must** use the `break-words` class to handle long, unbroken strings gracefully.
   -   `<CardDescription>`: Optional secondary text, like a URL path or short description.

## 2. Primary Icon & Color Picker

The primary icon is the main visual identifier for the card's entity within the Strm_ login and dashboard.

-   **Component**: `<GoogleSymbol>`
-   **Container**: The icon is placed within a `<Button variant="ghost" className="h-10 w-12 ...">`.
-   **Sizing**: The `<GoogleSymbol>` itself must be styled with `style={{fontSize: '36px'}}` and include `weight={100}` and `grade={-25}` for a large but light appearance.
-   **Color Picker**: A color swatch badge is overlaid on the icon's corner to trigger a `<Popover>` containing the color picker.
   -   The popover UI must use the `react-colorful` library.
   -   All color selection methods (wheel, hex input, swatches) **must** apply the change instantly. The "Set Color" button pattern is deprecated.

## 3. "Add New" & Duplicate Interaction

This interaction is for creating new entities or duplicating existing ones.

-   **Component**: A circular `<Button variant="ghost" size="icon" className="rounded-full ...">`.
-   **Icon**: The button contains a `<GoogleSymbol name="add_circle" className="text-4xl" weight={100} />`.
-   **Functionality**:
   -   **`onClick`**: Triggers the creation of a new, default item.
   -   **Drop Zone**: The button (or its wrapper) must be a `useDroppable` target to allow duplicating an item by dropping another card onto it.

## 4. Deletion Confirmation

Deleting a card is a destructive action and must be confirmed consistently across the Strm_ environment.

-   **Trigger**: A `cancel` icon button, typically revealed on hover in the top-right corner of the card.
-   **Dialog**: Clicking the trigger opens a **Compact Action Dialog**.
-   **Dialog Content**: This dialog **must** contain:
   1.  A large, centered `<GoogleSymbol name="delete" />` icon with destructive coloring.
   2.  A `<DialogTitle>` confirming the action (e.g., "Delete Page?").
   3.  A `<DialogDescription>` explaining that the action cannot be undone.

## Example Implementation Reference

For a complete, "gold-standard" implementation of this pattern, refer to the `PageCard` component in `/src/components/admin/page.tsx`. It correctly implements all aspects of this standardized pattern.
